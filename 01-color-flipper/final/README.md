This program randomly generates a hexadecimal color when a button is clicked and prints the hexadecimal value on the screen.

WHAT I DID:

The CSS and HTML were created as part of the tutorial, not by me.  I was responsible for all creating, connecting, and writing all code for both javascript files (app.js and hex.js)
